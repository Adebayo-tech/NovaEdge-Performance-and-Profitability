## 🎯 Key Business Problems Solved

### 1. **Unclear Profit Drivers**
> Many high-revenue products contributed little to overall profit.

✅ **Solved by** spotlighting high-profit margin products and identifying loss leaders like refrigerators with high cost ratios.

---

### 2. **Inefficient Marketing Budget Use**
> Difficulty in measuring marketing ROI.

✅ **Solved by** visualizing the correlation between marketing spend and revenue generation, revealing effective and ineffective campaigns.

---

### 3. **Seasonal Blind Spots**
> Missed opportunities during peak sales periods.

✅ **Solved by** showing monthly revenue and profit peaks in **March**, **June**, and **November**, guiding targeted campaign planning.

---

### 4. **Excess Procurement Costs**
> High costs were dragging down net margins in some product lines.

✅ **Solved by** isolating expensive products with poor profit returns and recommending supplier renegotiation or product lineup revision.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

This dashboard reflects **real-world decision-making** at the business level — not just reporting. By using Excel alone, it demonstrates mastery in:
- Transforming raw data into executive insights
- Designing readable, layered dashboards
- Answering real business questions with visuals and strategy
